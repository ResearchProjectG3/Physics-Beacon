                <p>Big Idea: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conversion of units is done to come up with accepted and understandable values.</li>
                    <li>Not all digits in a measurement are certain. Just like in life, you cannot be certain about what lies in the future. So, you have to prepare and work for it.</li>
                    <li>A reliable measurement is both precise and accurate.</li>
                    <li> A line graph is useful, as it shows how change in one quantity affects the change in another quantity. Knowing how to construct graphs helps you when you want t see and compare development or progress.</li>

                <p>Trivia: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A quantity can be expressed using the English or the metric system of measurement. The English system uses specific conversion factors, whereas the metric system uses measurements in powers of 10. In science, SI units are commonly
                        used as the standard system of measurement</li>
                    <li>To convert one unit of measurement into another, a technique called dimensional analysis is used. Dimensional analysis uses unit equalities that show the equivalent amounts of different units.</li>
                    <li>Very small or very big numbers can be written in shorter form using scientific notation</li>
                    <li>The reliability of measurement depends on its accuracy and precision. Accuracy describes how close a measurement is to the true value. Precision, on the other hand, describes the consistency or closeness of the measurements with one
                        another.
                    </li>
                    <li>The least count is the smallest interval in the calibration of the measuring instrument. Based on the least count, certain and uncertain digits in the measurements can be determined.</li>
                    <li>There are different possible sources for errors in measurement. Random errors come from unknown or unpredictable variations in experimental situations, and systematic errors are attributed to measuring instruments used or techniques
                        employed.
                    </li>
                    <li>A graph is a pictorial representation that shows the trend and relationship among variables.</li>

                        parallelogram and the polygon methods. The analytical method uses concepts in trigonometry to add the x, y, and z components of the vectors.</li>

                    <li>Displacement tells about the shortest distance an object can travel. You can use this idea in your everyday life to save your time and energy. Take the shortest route to go to your usual destination.</li>

                    <li>Distance is a scalar quantity, whereas displacement is a vector quantity. Distance is defined as the length of the total path the object has moved; displacement is the shortest length between the initial position and the final position
                        of the object. </li>
                    <li>Speed is also a scalar quantity, whereas velocity is a vector quantity. Speed is a measure of how fast or slow a body moves. Speed is the slope of the line in a graph of position vs. time.</li>
                    <li>Acceleration is a measure of how fast or slow velocity changes. It is the slope of a line in the velocity versus time graph.</li>

                    <li>Free-falling objects, like all objects, are influenced by gravity, which pulls them down toward the center of Earth. In life, there are many things that can pull you down. They hinder you from reaching your goals. You should do your

                <ul>
                    <li>Projectiles move toward the ground because of the influence of gravity. Similarly, this tells you that there are forces that can influence your success. All you have to do is to learn to deal with these forces so that you can still
                        reach your goal.
                    </li>
                    <li>In uniform circular motion, there is a change only in direction but not in speed. In real life, you may also demonstrate circular motion. Even though you may change directions (or alter your plans) as you go along with your life, make
                        sure that you are still headed toward your goals.</li>

                    <li>A projectile is an object with an initial velocity and whose path is determined by the effects of gravity and air resistance. If air resistance is neglected, gravity affects only the vertical motion of the projectile while the horizontal
                        motion is constant. </li>
                    <li>A body that moves in a circle with constant speed is moving in uniform circular motion.</li>
                    <li>In specifying velocity, you have to specify the frame of reference because motion is relative. Velocities (and other kinematic quantities) depend on the reference where the measurement is taken.</li>

                    <li>Like Newton's first law, your life will retain its state of being unless you do something to make it better</li>
                    <li>In the third law of motion, if there is an action, there will be a reaction. In real-life situations, good deeds can yield the same. Thus, be reminded of the golden rule: do unto others what you want others to do unto you.</li>

                <p>Trivia:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Force is an interaction between bodies. It can be classified as contact or noncontact. Some examples of forces acting on a body are weight, tension, normal force, and friction. Free-body diagrams are used to show the forces acting
                        on a body.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are three laws of motion. Newton's first law states that the body will retain its state of motion (whether at rest or initially moving) unless acted upon by a net force. When a net force acts on an object, its acceleration is
                        proportional to and the same direction as this net force and inversely proportional to its mass as described by Newton's second law. Last, the third law of motion states that for every force, there is an interacting force with
                        equal magnitude and opposite direction.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Work requires force and distance to be done. In anything that you do, you must exert effort (force) so you can go far (distance).</li>
                    <li>The more power you have, the more work you can do. In the movie Spiderman, the main character's father says, "With great power comes great responsibility."</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Work is the dot product of force and displacement. The SI unit of work is joule. Graphically, work is the area under the curve of a force vs. position graph. The rate of doing work is called power. The SI unit of power is watt.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mechanical energy can be classified as kinetic or potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy by virtue of a body's motion. Potential energy is associated with the position of a body. The work-energy theorem states that the net
                        work done by a net force on a body is equal to the change in the body's kinetic energy. </li>
                    <li>One of the most important concepts in physics is the principle of conservation of energy. It states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed but can be transformed from one form to another.</li>

                <p>Big Idea:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The momentum of an object depends on its mass and velocity. An object that has great mass and velocity will most probably have a large momentum. The larger the momentum of an object, the greater is the impact.</li>
                    <li>Conservation of momentum simply means that no momentum is lost. The value of momentum is the same before and after the interaction of forces.</li>
                    <li>What you consider to be the center of your life tells where your concentration is directed at, which defines who you are.</li>

                <p>Trivia:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The inertia of a body by virtue of its motion is described by momentum. The change in momentum of an object is equal to the impulse acting on it. This is called the impulse momentum theorem. Impulse is defined as the product of the
                        net force and the time at which the net force is in contact with the object.</li>
                    <li>In an isolated system, the total momentum is constant. This is called the conservation of momentum. An interesting application of this principle is in collisions. An elastic collision is a kind of collision wherein both the total momentum
                        and the kinetic energy are conserved. When the kinetic energy is not conserved, the collision is inelastic. A special kind of inelastic collision wherein the bodies stick to each other after the collision is called a completely
                        inelastic collision.

                    <li>There are many analogies between linear motion and rotational motion. </li>
                    <li>In linear motion, you can describe the motion of an object using kinematics and dynamics quantities such as velocity, acceleration, force, and energy. In rotational motion, you can describe the rotation of rigid bodies using the rotational

                    <li>The conservation laws are also applicable in rotational motion. Likewise, the total mechanical energy, including the linear and rotational components of energy, is conserved. </li>
                    <li>A body is said to be in the state of equilibrium when two requirements are met. First, the vector sum of the forces acting on the body must be zero. Second, the net torque at any point in the rigid body must also be zero.</li>

                    <li>Discoveries in science are products of great thinkers who were not afraid to accept help and ideas from others. Asking help from others is not a weakness; rather, it shows strength in accepting that you cannot do all things by yourself.</li>
                    <li>During life's most difficult times, we should liken ourselves to satellites. Even though it may seem that our plans are falling or coming apart, we should not let ourselves hit rock bottom. Life has rising and falling moments. It does
                        not matter if you fall. What matters is you know how to get up with every failure.</li>

                    <li>An oscillation or vibration is a back-and-forth movement in time, whereas a wave is a back-and-forth movement in both space and time. An oscillating object or oscillator is moving in simple harmonic motion if its acceleration is proportional
                        and opposite to its displacement. </li>
                    <li>Waves can be transverse, longitudinal, or both. A wave that requires a medium to propagate is called a mechanical wave.</li>
                    <li>Sound waves are longitudinal waves. Loudness is quantitatively described using sound intensity levels measured in units of decibels. Just like other waves, the frequency of a sound heard by the listener may be different from the frequency
                        of a sound emitted by the source if there is a relative motion between the two. This phenomenon is called the Doppler effect.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The density of a substance is an intensive property that gives the ratio of its mass and its volume. The ratio of the density of a substance and the density of water is called specific gravity. </li>
                    <li>Pressure is defined as force per unit area perpendicular to the force. For fluids, the pressure increases with density and depth. According to Pascal's principle, if an external pressure is applied to a confined fluid, the pressure
                        at every point within the fluid increases by the same amount. This principle has found many applications in hydraulics and brake systems in automobiles. </li>
                    <li>According to Archimedes' principle, the amount of buoyant force acting on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. When the density of the object is lower than the density of the liquid where it is submerged, the
                        object floats; otherwise, it sinks. </li>
                    <li>The continuity equation relates the diameter of a tube and the flow speed. On the other hand, Bernoulli's principle relates the pressure of the fluid and its flow speed.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Heat can increase the length and the volume of substances. Thermal expansion has many useful applications such as in the construction of bridges and railroad tracks, to name a few.</li>
                    <li>Different objects need different amounts of energy to heat up. This explains why there are substances that become hot quickly and substances that heat up slowly. Also, heat transfers when two bodies have different temperatures.</li>
                    <li>Matter undergoes essential phase changes made possible by heat. Phase changes are important processes as they turn matter to more useful forms that we can use.</li>
                    <li>Heat can be transferred in various ways. People have applied the different mechanisms of heat transfer to suit their needs.</li>

                <p>Trivia:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The zeroth law of thermodynamics gives conditions for thermal equilibrium. It is a state where objects have the same or equal temperature. From this, temperature can be defined macroscopically as a property that determines whether
                        bodies are in thermal equilibrium with each other or not. </li>
                    <li>Temperature can be measured using thermometers calibrated using different scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and kelvin. Note that many objects expand when their temperatures increase. </li>
                    <li>Heat can be transferred through conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction occurs for bodies in contact. Convection takes place through the movement of fluids. Lastly, radiation is facilitated by the emission or the absorption
                        of electromagnetic waves.

                    <li>The ideal gas does not exist. But it has been the basis of concepts of other gas laws to explain different processes. To set up an ideal principle is not bad because it actually gives you a certain standard or benchmark that can help
                        you achieve your goals in life.</li>

                    <li>An ideal gas can be described macroscopically by the equation of state PV = nRT. Meanwhile, this equation is based microscopically on the kinetic molecular theory that neglects the volume of the gas and the intermolecular forces, and
                        it assumes that the collision between gas particles as elastic. </li>
                    <li>Thermodynamic processes can be described graphically using pV diagrams. Some examples of thermodynamic processes are the following: isothermal (constant temperature), isobaric (constant pressure), isochoric (no work), and adiabatic
                        (no heat) processes.
                    </li>

                <p>Big Idea:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Natural processes are irreversible processes. In life, there are also things you've done that you cannot undo. So, you must thoroughly think about your decisions and activities, as they may have irrevocable consequences on your future.</li>
                    <li>Entropy tells us that matter can have many states due to the disorderliness of molecules brought about by heat. In real life, knowing entropy can help you determine what can and what cannot happen when you are exposed to many possibilities.
                        You must also evaluate each possibility and option carefully.</li>
                    <li>The second law of thermodynamics tells you that though an event is possible, it may be highly improbable to occur. But this should not stop you from looking into the many possibilities that you are offered. A rich imagination has always
                        been a tool in achieving success.</li>

            <div class="contbox">
                <p>Trivia:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The second law of thermodynamics gives limitation to the first law by stating the preferred direction of natural processes. Here, natural processes proceed spontaneously in the direction of greater disorder or entropy. </li>
                    <li>In terms of heat flow, this direction toward increasing disorderliness corresponds to heat flowing spontaneously from hot to cold objects (Clausius statement). Similarly, heat cannot be spontaneously and completely converted into work
                        (Kelvin-Planck statement). All natural processes are irreversible processes. </li>
                    <li>A heat engine is a device that can be used to convert heat partially into work. Meanwhile, the Carnot engine is an idealized engine that can give the higher possible efficiency consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. A Carnot
                        cycle is composed of reversible processes consisting of two isothermal and two adiabatic processes.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Opposite charges in an atom attract each other. If the positive charges of an atom outnumber the negative charges, the atom is a positive ion. If there are more negative charges than positive charges, the atom is a negative ion. </li>
                    <li>An object that holds its electrons weakly will eventually lose them when rubbed with another object that has a stronger hold in its electrons. Similarly, you should strongly hold on to whatever is important to you so that you won't
                        lose it when rough times come or when you need it.</li>
                    <li>Bringing an object with a strong positive charge near an object with a neutral charge can make the latter acquire a charge similar to the strong one. Likewise, mingling with people with positive dispositions can make you acquire their
                        positivity

                <ul>
                    <li>Electric charge is the property of subatomic particles that determines their interaction with other charged particles. The electric charge of a body is expressed in integer multiples of e, and the unit coulomb (C) is used to measure
                        the electric charge. Charges can be either positive or negative. Similar charges repel, and unlike ones attract. </li>
                    <li>Electrically neutral bodies can acquire charges by friction or rubbing, conduction, or induction. In these methods, electron transfer plays a significant role.</li>
                    <li>A body with a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end is called an electric dipole. This occurs as an effect of a strongly positive or strongly negative charge being brought near an electrically neutral body.

                <ul>
                    <li>As charges move farther from each other, the electrostatic force between them weakens. As they move nearer to each other, this force strengthens. You can relate this science concept in real life to the concept of relationships. As
                        two people move farther from each other, their friendship usually weakens because of their separation . On the other hand, friendship tends to be stronger when two people find time to be together.</li>
                    <li>The superposition principle states the individual electrostatic forces are added as vectors to yield a single resultant vector. Similarly, you can say that the positive and negative traits of a person or part of his or her identity.
                    </li>
                    <li>Electric field lines are represented by arrows showing the direction of the electric field from the positive charge to the negative charge. In life, people who have positive values tend to be givers, whereas individuals with negative
                        attitudes just want to take without giving.

                <ul>
                    <li>The electrostatic force is the attraction or repulsion between electric charges. The law on electric charges state that similar charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract one another. This force is measured using the unit
                        newton and is computed using Coulomb’s law for electrostatics. The superposition principle implies that electrostatic forces can be added as vectors to yield a resultant force .
                    </li>
                    <li>As you move away from a charge, the electrostatic force weakens. The area around a charge where an electrostatic force experienced by a test charge is referred to as the electric field. Furthermore, electric field lines emanate from
                        positive charges and terminate at negative charges. The electric field is measured using the unit newton per coulomb.
                    </li>
                    <li>Gauss’s law for electrostatics quantifies the flow of electric field at any region in space. This flow is the electric flux and is measured using the unit volt-meter.

                    <li>Current is the steady flow of charges along a conductor for every unit of time. It is measured using the unit ampere (A). </li>
                    <li>For electric current to flow, an electromotive force or EMF must push” the charges through the conductor. Electromotive force is measured using the unit volt (V).</li>
                    <li>The limiting factor to current flow is the quantity known as resistance. The resistivity of the conductor, its length, and its cross-sectional area are factors that affect its resistance. Resistivity and length are directly proportional
                        to resistance. The crosssectional area, however, is inversely proportional to it. Temperature also directly affects the conductivity of a material. Higher temperature results in higher resistance and lower conductivity.
                    </li>
                    <li>A circuit provides a pathway for an electric current to be delivered from its source to the load where it would be used. A functional circuit is referred to as a closed circuit. A schematic diagram is used to represent an actual circuit.

                    <li>Every material produces magnetic effects depending on its permeability. Low values of permeability results in satellite changes in the magnetic field; asnd large values cause significant changes.</li>
                    <li>The strength of the magnetic field aroun the magnetic pole is a magnetic flux. The magnetic flux is measured using the unit weber (Wb). This flux is constant at fixed distances around a magnetic pole. If this is changed by a conductor
                        that cuts through it, then an EMF is induced (Faraday's Law). This is the main principle that makes power generation and power distribution [possible. Induced EMF produces current with an associated magnetic flux. This flux tends
                        to cancel out the effects of the flux that induced the EMF (Lenz's law).</li>
                    <li>Direct current (DC) flows in a single direction along a conductor depending on how the EMF source is connected to the circuit. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions alternating along a circuit. These two types of current
                        have respective uses,, but one can be used to produce the other.</li>
                    <li>LC circuits contain both a capacitor and an inductor. The passing of energy from a conductor to the inductor can be likened to a spring-mass system, which can be used to demonstrate an infinite process under ideal conditions.</li>

                        This alternate production goes on for as lng as the charge is vibrating, resulting in the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Visible light is a form of an electromagnetic wave.</li>
                    <li>Light behaves in various ways depending on the optical medium that it wil approach. If it approaches a reflecting surface, then reflection will take place. If it approaches a rough surface, then refraction will occur. In some cases,
                        total internal reflection might take place especially when the angle of incidence is greater than the critica angle associated with the medium. If white lights refracts more than once as it penetrates an optical medium, vthen it
                        can undergo dispersion wherein you can see the different colors that make up white light.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The real side of a mirror is where reflected rays should be. Its virtual sides are where these rays should not be. Similarly in life, where you should be is considered your real place. The place where you should not be can be called
                        your virtual side.</li>
                    <li>Converging lenses concentrate refracted rays to a single point. These are used to create images for the eyes of individuals suffering from farsightedness. Diverging lenses, on the other hand, scatter these rays. A pair of these lenses
                        is needed to correct the vision of those suffering from nearsightedness.</li>
                    <li>Converging lenses are positive lenses as they collect refracted rays to a single point called the focus. Diverging lenses are negative because they scatter the rays after refraction from the lens. Similarly to life, promoting unity
                        in a group is considered positive, whereas showing distorted or scattering results in something negative.</li>

                    <li>A lens forms an image from the light rays that it refracts. Lenses can be classified based on how they refract light rays. Converging lenses “collect” refracted rays to a single point. Diverging lenses, on the other hand, cannot be
                        projected.

                    <li>Polarization diminishes the intensity of light or its glaring effects on the eyes. This is the mechanism behind the polarizing sunglasses.</li>
                    <li>Constructive interference involves two waves that superpose. Light becomes brighter or sounds become louder because of this kind of interference. Destructive interference happens when two waves that are 180 out of phase undergo superposition.

                <p>Trivia:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Polarization refers to the “filtering” of light as it passes through a polarizing medium. Some of the light waves are absorbed by the medium, while the other light waves pass through. This behavior of light reduces its glaring effect
                        of intensity.</li>
                    <li>Interference of light takes place whenever two or more coherent waves interact in the same medium. This behavior of light can result in either constructive interference or destructive interference. The former takes place whenever the
                        waves are in-phase. The latter occurs if the waves are 180 out of phase.</li>
                    <li>Diffraction is the bending of light rays as these are obstructed. This results in the formation of diffraction fringes that affect the accuracy of the measurements of the properties of light.</li>

                    <li>The theory of relativity implies that describing the motion of a body depends on its observers. Fast-moving bodies are heavier according to the theory of relativity.</li>
                    <li>So far, nothing has been found to be faster than light. If something would be found in the future, then you would have a new understanding of the universe. This is how scientific knowledge develops.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The first postulate of special relativity states that all motion is relative or dependent on the one making the observation. However, the second postulate gives an exception for the motion of light, which is the same for all observers.
                        These postulates produce certain consequences especially for fast-moving bodies.</li>
                    <li>The consequences of special relativity are as follows: fast-moving bodies are heavier than bodies at rest; fast-moving clocks tick slower than stationary ones; fast-moving bodies are observed to contract as they move; and velocities
                        are not simply added when a fast-moving body ejects another fast-moving body. Another consequence of special relativity is its influence in the Doppler effect.</li>
                    <li> In the theory of relativity, mass and energy are equivalent. Although this concept is still theoretical, reasons suggest that this equivalence is possible.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Light propagates as a particle in the form of photons. These particles possess energy that allow light to travel in a straight line. When these particles get in contact with the material, the photoelectric effect results, wherein electrons
                        are ejected from the surface of the material.</li>
                    <li>Each atom has an associated set of energy levels that explain the phenomena of atomic emission and atomic absorption. Emission takes place when an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, thus releasing photons
                        from the atom. Absorption takes place when an electron moves from a lower energy level to a higher energy level by absorbing photons.</li>
                    <li>Radioactive materials are heavy elements that have unstable nuclei. Half of the sample of these elements decays after each half-life of the element.</li>
